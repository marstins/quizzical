## Quizzical

Quizzical is a web application created to test your knowledge.

It was suggested as a challenge by Bob Ziroll at Scrimba's React Basics course, which is part of The Frontend Developer Career Path. Created using ReactJS, Quizzical uses Open Trivia DB's (https://opentdb.com/) API to provide the questions and answers.

The app can be tested at https://marstins.github.io/quizzical/

Have fun!
